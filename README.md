# 42_so_long

My *so_long* project for **42 Nice**, last updated on February 11th 2023, at 20:44.

## Presentation

I'm doing this project for **42 Nice**, just after finishing *pipex* with bonuses.

I've loved video games since I was 3 and my mom did the unthinkable and bought me a gray *Nintendo DS* with *New Super Mario Bros.*. It was all downhill from there...  
Since then, I've owned every Nintendo console, a PC, a PSP and a PS4. You can see the extent of my addiction on [my HLTB page].

Needless to say, I've been eyeing this project for a while now, and I'm finally doing it!

I already have a good idea of what I'll be doing, I want to make a *Yoshi's Island* (SNES) inspired game. Well, only for the bonuses.  
I'll first make the mandatory part to become familiar with the **MLX**, and then I'll move on to the serious stuff.  
Wish me luck as I embark on this journey!
